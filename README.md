How to use our GameServer

1. First run Server.java -- this will start the server.

2. Run Client.java -- this will begin the client interaction 

3. If you have not used the GameServer before, select "New Account" 

4. Enter a username and password to create your account. Verify your password. Users will be reprompted if their passwords do not match.

5. Next, login. Select "Existing Account" to log in. The users will be reprompted if their username/password are not found. 

6. Choose a game! Users can select to play "Othello", "Checkers", or "TicTacToe". Please note, that the logic instantiated for Checkers forces users to make a jump if they can do so. 

7. Repeat steps 2-6 to add another player. 

8. Once users complete a game, they are prompted asking if they would like to play another. They can choose to play any of the three games implemented at this point.

Have fun!
